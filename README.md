# Restaurant Annual Turnover Prediction - Championship Solution

## 🎯 Problem Overview

**Objective**: Predict the Annual Turnover of restaurants based on 33+ features
**Metric**: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
**Target**: Beat the current best RMSE of **12,337,503.37**
**Data**: 3,493 training samples, 500 test samples

## 📊 Dataset Analysis

### Initial Data Exploration
- **Training Set**: 3,493 restaurants with 34 features
- **Test Set**: 500 restaurants with 33 features (missing Annual Turnover)
- **Target Variable**: Annual Turnover (highly variable: ~20M to 110M range)

### Key Challenges Identified
1. **Missing Values**: Facebook/Instagram popularity, ratings, tier information
2. **Data Inconsistencies**: Column name mismatch between train/test ("Endorsed By" vs "Endoresed By")
3. **Mixed Data Types**: Numerical, categorical, date, and text features
4. **High Variance**: Target variable spans multiple orders of magnitude
5. **Small Test Set**: Only 500 samples for final evaluation

## 🛠️ Solution Evolution

### Phase 1: Basic Ensemble (RMSE: ~20.4M)
**File**: `restaurant_turnover_predictor.py`

**Initial Approach**:
- Basic missing value imputation with medians
- Simple categorical encoding
- Standard ensemble of RF, XGB, LightGBM, GradientBoosting
- Cross-validation weighting

**Key Features Created**:
```python
# Basic time features
restaurant_age = 2024 - opening_year
social_media_avg = (facebook + instagram) / 2
service_score = mean(service_ratings)
quality_score = mean(quality_ratings)
```

**Results**: RMSE ~20.4M (not competitive)

### Phase 2: Advanced Feature Engineering (RMSE: ~19.5M)
**File**: `winning_solution.py`

**Improvements**:
- Advanced missing value strategies
- Cuisine analysis with count and type detection
- Location-based features
- Rating consistency metrics
- Binary amenity scoring

**New Features**:
```python
# Cuisine sophistication
cuisine_count = cuisine.str.count(',') + 1
has_premium_cuisine = contains(['japanese', 'french', 'italian'])
has_ethnic_cuisine = contains(['indian', 'chinese', 'thai'])

# Social media power features
social_media_max = max(facebook, instagram)
social_media_diff = facebook - instagram
is_social_media_star = (social_avg > 90)

# Interaction features
tier_celebrity_interaction = tier1 * celebrity_endorsed
social_quality_interaction = social_avg * quality_score
```

**Results**: RMSE ~19.5M (improvement but still not competitive)

### Phase 3: Championship Feature Engineering (RMSE: ~19.4M)
**File**: `final_solution.py`

**Major Enhancements**:

#### 1. **Advanced Age Transformations**
```python
# Restaurant lifecycle modeling
age_squared = restaurant_age ** 2
age_cubed = restaurant_age ** 3
age_log = log1p(restaurant_age)
age_sqrt = sqrt(restaurant_age)
age_inv = 1 / (restaurant_age + 1)

# Lifecycle categories
is_new = (age <= 2)
is_established = (2 < age <= 10)
is_veteran = (age > 10)
```

#### 2. **Sophisticated Cuisine Analysis**
```python
# Multi-category cuisine classification
premium_cuisines = ['italian', 'japanese', 'french', 'mediterranean', 'greek']
popular_cuisines = ['indian', 'chinese', 'thai', 'american']
ethnic_cuisines = ['korean', 'vietnamese', 'mexican', 'turkish']

# Cuisine diversity scoring
cuisine_diversity = (has_premium > 0) + (has_popular > 0) + (has_ethnic > 0)
```

#### 3. **Social Media Power Features**
```python
# Advanced social media metrics
social_harmonic_mean = 2 * fb * insta / (fb + insta + 1)
social_power = social_avg ** 0.5
social_squared = social_avg ** 2
social_log = log1p(social_avg)

# Social media categories
social_excellent = (social_avg >= 90)
social_good = (70 <= social_avg < 90)
social_poor = (social_avg < 50)
```

#### 4. **Composite Rating Engineering**
```python
# Specialized rating scores
service_excellence = mean(['Staff Responsiveness', 'Service'])
food_quality = mean(['Food Rating', 'Hygiene Rating'])
value_proposition = mean(['Value for Money', 'Overall Rating'])
atmosphere = mean(['Ambience', 'Lively', 'Comfort'])
entertainment = mean(['Live Music', 'Comedy', 'Sports'])
efficiency = 10 - order_wait_time  # Inverted wait time
```

#### 5. **Statistical Feature Analysis**
```python
# Rating distribution analysis
rating_avg = mean(all_ratings)
rating_std = std(all_ratings)
rating_max = max(all_ratings)
rating_min = min(all_ratings)
rating_range = rating_max - rating_min
rating_consistency = 10 - rating_std  # Higher = more consistent
```

#### 6. **Power Interaction Features**
```python
# High-impact combinations
premium_celebrity = tier1_restaurant * celebrity_endorsed
quality_social = food_quality * social_avg / 100
age_quality = restaurant_age * overall_rating
location_tier = business_hub * tier1_city
premium_location = premium_cuisine_count * business_hub
social_age = social_avg / (restaurant_age + 1)
quality_amenities = food_quality * total_amenities
```

#### 7. **Mathematical Transformations**
```python
# Non-linear transformations
social_power_transform = power(social_avg, 0.3)
quality_exp = exp(food_quality / 10)
age_log_interaction = age_log * overall_rating

# Efficiency ratios
rating_per_amenity = overall_rating / (total_amenities + 1)
quality_per_wait = food_quality / (order_wait_time + 1)
social_consistency = social_avg / (rating_std + 0.1)
value_efficiency = value_for_money * efficiency / 10
```

### Phase 4: Championship Ensemble Design

inv_scores = {name: min_score/score for name, score in cv_scores.items()}
weights = {name: inv_score/total_inv for name, inv_score in inv_scores.items()}
```
